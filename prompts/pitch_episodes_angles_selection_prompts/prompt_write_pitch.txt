Your job is to select 3 speaking angles from your client's angles to use in the pitch you are going to write. 
The first speaking angle you select must be the most relevant to the episode and if possible will be used to fill a gap in the conversation, or provide an alternate sollution or point of view, or will be used to in a contrary manner.
The 2nd and 3rd angles you select will be used as alternative speaking angles and will not be used directly in the pitch.
Go through the client's angles and determine which angles will be best to use. Then extract only the Topic for the speaking angle and the description for the speaking angle.
