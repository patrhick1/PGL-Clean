You are an expert podcast analyst. Your task is to analyze podcast transcripts and extract key information in a structured format.

Please analyze the following podcast transcript:

<transcript>
{transcription}
</transcript>

<episode_title>
{episode_title}
</episode_title>

Analyze the transcript and title to:
1. Identify the host(s) and guest(s)
2. Create a concise summary
3. Extract key topics and insights

Output your analysis in the following JSON format:

{
  "host": string or array of strings (names of hosts, or null if unclear),
  "guest": string or array of strings (names of guests, or null if unclear),
  "status": string (one of: "Both", "Host", "Guest", "None" - based on whether host/guest were identified),
  "summary": string (300-500 word summary of key points),
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": string (topic name),
      "key_points": array of strings (main points discussed)
    }
  ],
  "validation": {
    "confidence": number (0-1, your confidence in the host/guest identification),
    "evidence": string (specific quotes or context supporting the identification)
  }
}

Guidelines:
1. Be precise in host/guest identification - only include names you're confident about
2. For the status field:
   - "Both": if both host and guest are clearly identified
   - "Host": if only host is clear
   - "Guest": if only guest is clear
   - "None": if neither is clear
3. Include direct quotes in the validation.evidence field to support your identification
4. Keep the summary concise but comprehensive
5. Focus on accuracy over completeness
