# Script Optimization Guide: Strategies from PGL Podcast Outreach Scripts

This guide analyzes the optimization patterns observed when comparing the original scripts with their optimized versions. These patterns can be applied to other scripts in the project to improve performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## 1. Class-Based Architecture

### Before:
- Scripts were structured as monolithic functions with minimal modularization
- Logic for different operations mixed together in long functions
- Difficult to reuse components or extend functionality

### After:
- Object-oriented approach with dedicated processor classes
- Clear separation of concerns with methods for specific tasks
- Better encapsulation of related functionality
- Example: `DetermineFitProcessor`, `PitchWriterProcessor` classes

## 2. Asynchronous Processing

### Before:
- Synchronous, blocking operations
- Processing records one at a time
- Long wait times during API calls

### After:
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- Concurrent processing of multiple records
- Semaphores to control concurrency levels
- Functions like `process_batch()` that handle multiple records simultaneously
- AsyncIO for efficient I/O operations

## 3. Structured API Interactions

### Before:
- Direct API calls with minimal parsing
- Handling raw string outputs
- Multiple steps to extract structured data

### After:
- LangChain integration for structured outputs
- Pydantic models for type validation (e.g., `FitAssessment`, `PitchTopic`)
- Consistent error handling around API calls
- Clear prompting patterns with templates

## 4. Enhanced Error Handling & Resilience

### Before:
- Basic try/except blocks
- Limited retry logic
- Missing error context in logs

### After:
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- Robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Detailed logging of error contexts
- Circuit breaker patterns for failing operations
- Graceful degradation on failures

## 5. Batch Processing with Controls

### Before:
- Processing all records at once
- No pausing between operations
- Limited control over execution flow

### After:
- Records processed in configurable batches
- Controlled delays between batches to prevent rate limits
- Semaphores to limit concurrent API calls
- Stop flags checked at strategic points for clean termination

## 6. Performance Optimization

### Before:
- Redundant API calls
- Inefficient token usage
- No caching or reuse of resources

### After:
- Token counting and optimization
- Smart retries only when appropriate
- Model selection based on task complexity
- Tokenizer integration for accurate token counting

## 7. Monitoring & Metrics

### Before:
- Limited logging
- No performance tracking
- Difficult to identify bottlenecks

### After:
- Comprehensive logging with appropriate levels
- Structured metrics collection (tokens, execution time)
- Usage tracking via the AI tracker
- Statistics summaries for analysis

## 8. Resource Efficiency

### Before:
- Using expensive models for all tasks
- No consideration of token costs
- Fixed timeouts and retries

### After:
- Using less expensive models when appropriate (e.g., Haiku vs. Sonnet)
- Careful prompt engineering to reduce token usage
- Adaptive retry strategies based on error types
- Truncation of inputs when appropriate

## 9. Prompt Template Management

### Before:
- Hardcoded prompts or simple file loading
- Limited prompt flexibility

### After:
- Structured prompt templates with variable substitution
- Error handling for template loading
- Fallback templates for emergencies
- Templates stored in dedicated locations

## 10. Code Maintainability

### Before:
- Minimal comments and documentation
- Long, complex functions
- Duplicated code patterns

### After:
- Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Smaller, focused methods with single responsibilities
- Clear naming conventions
- Consistent patterns across different scripts

## How to Apply These Optimizations

1. **Start with Architecture**: Convert existing scripts to class-based design
2. **Add Async Processing**: Identify blocking operations and make them async
3. **Implement Structured Outputs**: Use Pydantic models for API responses
4. **Enhance Error Handling**: Add proper retry mechanisms and logging
5. **Add Batch Processing**: Process records in controlled batches
6. **Optimize Resources**: Select appropriate models and control token usage
7. **Improve Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and metrics collection
8. **Refactor Prompts**: Use template system for all prompts

By applying these patterns consistently across all scripts, you can significantly improve the performance, reliability, and maintainability of the entire system.
